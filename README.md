# Getting Started

Glad you are here to use MCS Android SDK! We supposed you have already followed [the tutorial of MCS Android SDK](https://mtk-mcs.gitbooks.io/mcs-sdk-android-tutorial-doc/content/), and navigate here to see detailed description for each component of SDK.

We will try our best to explain some hidden logic which is not described in the tutorial as simple as possible. 
You are welcomed to contact us at <mtkcloudsandbox@mediatek.com> !
